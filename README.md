INFO5430 Group Final Project "What makes a 5 star Airbnb" 
Team Member: Linjing Rao, Mingyu Huang, Yubang Wu


Staying at an Airbnb instead of a regular hotel has become the new fashion for travelers around
the world, the temptation to get a taste of the local lifestyle in the exotic land ranging from a
cheap living room coach stay to a luxurious private mansion can be irresistible. This rising
demand has attracted many hosts to join the market, New York City even has more Airbnb
listings than apartment rentals. But once the host signed up and joined the platform, how to win
the 5.0-star rating becomes the ultimate challenge for sustaining the popularity of their airbnb.
With the detailed listings and reviews dataset of New York City, provided by Inside Airbnb, our
analysis aimed to unlock the secret ingredient for a 5.0 start airbnb. We analyzed the impact of
location, airbnb host response rate, the amenities provided and the review comments. The results
show that location is not necessarily the most influential factor for a top 5.0 airbnb but good
location does make your airbnb more popular. And with more people staying, the more likely
you are to get good review comments and achieve that 5.0 Starts.
